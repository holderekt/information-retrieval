# information-retrieval
Information Retrieval Algorithms. Simple program made to
 test all the knowledge gathered during the course
 "Information Retrieval Methods".
The main goal of this project is to index all documents
and books of my university courses and give the best result
on a given query. The project is and will remain a **work in progress**.

The program indexes files using a **reverse index**,
 the words are weighted using **TF-IDF** (the query
 words are weighted using only TF).
 The main ranking functon is **cosine
 similarity** but simple TF-IDF is also avaiable.
  The program supports only PDF files.

## Future Aims
Some relevance feedback from the user, 
a JavaFX UI and some kind of evaluation algorithm to ensure the 
relevance of the documents retrieved
